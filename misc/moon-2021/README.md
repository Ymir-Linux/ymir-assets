# Ymir GNU/Linux image for the Moon!

This image was created specifically for sending this [to the moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/l52iym/you_can_send_something_to_the_moon_for_free_im/) for the Ymir GNU/Linux project. Thanks to [/u/Valphon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Valphon/). Without his generosity this probably wouldn't have been possible for this project.
